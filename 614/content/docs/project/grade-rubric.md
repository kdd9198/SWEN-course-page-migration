- * Overall Effort, Design & Execution
  * The team used all 5 required AWS technologies and integrated at least one additional AWS service in a meaningful way. The project demonstrated strong technical depth, thoughtful design, and went beyond the assignment’s core requirements. Execution was complete, polished, and showed clear evidence of extra effort and innovation.
  * The team used all 5 required AWS technologies and may have included an additional service. The solution met assignment requirements with acceptable complexity and effort, though it remained within standard expectations. Execution was mostly complete, with only minor gaps or missed opportunities for enhancement.
  * The team used all 5 required AWS technologies, but the solution lacked expected complexity, depth, or integration. Implementation showed limited effort, minimal technical design, or noticeable gaps in functionality. Project goals were only partially met.
  * The team used 5 or fewer required AWS technologies, but the solution was either incomplete, poorly integrated, or lacking in complexity. Significant execution issues were present, and the project did not meet core objectives or reflect sufficient effort.
