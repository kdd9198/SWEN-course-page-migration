## Course Syllabus

### Instructor

Mike Zaharkin
Email: mszvse@rit.edu

### Course time and Location

* Classes: Monday and Wednesdays 6:30 – 7:45PM
* Office Time: By Appointment (in-person or via Zoom)

### Description

This course focuses on designing and implementing cloud software systems. It introduces the basic concepts and knowledge on cloud computing systems and application infrastructure. Topics are covered via hands-on class instruction, application development in teams, course materials, and class discussions. In addition, a team programming project and a demo presentation will be required for all students.

Upon completing this course, students will attain the following objectives:

* Gain a comprehensive understanding of cloud-native development principles and best practices, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, and microservices. This knowledge will enable the construction of resilient and scalable applications optimized for cloud environments.
* Acquire in-depth insights into how cloud capabilities address fundamental challenges in performance, scalability, and reliability. This includes multi-region deployments, autoscaling, and automated failover strategies, which enhance application resilience.
* Critically assess the trade-offs between cloud-native and on-premises infrastructure, with a specific focus on cost-effectiveness, elasticity, operational complexity, and the role of cloud infrastructure in facilitating faster innovation while managing technical debt.
* Develop a foundational understanding of cloud cost management and optimization strategies. This knowledge will facilitate efficient resource allocation, budgeting, and real-time cost monitoring to maximize the return on investment of cloud deployments.
* Design secure, resilient, and high-performance cloud architectures. This will involve leveraging AWS tools, Terraform configurations, and selective DevOps practices to implement autoscaling, load balancing, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery mechanisms.
* Identify and address critical security, compliance, and data privacy challenges associated with cloud computing. This will involve utilizing Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices, data encryption, monitoring, and secure configuration management to establish environments that adhere to industry standards and regulations.

### Course Schedule

The [class schedule](/) can be found in the **Content > Course Details** section in myCourses. Note that this is subject to change, and this will be kept up to date throughout the semester.

### Textbook

There are no required textbooks for this course. All lectures and reference material presented in class will be posted in the **Content** section in myCourses.

### AWS Accounts

We will be using AWS for class activities, homework, and the term project. Since there are no textbooks required, students will need to have their own AWS account.

As of July 15, 2025, AWS has updated its Free Tier program (https://aws.amazon.com/free/). As a result, students will need to sign up for a Paid Plan, which includes up to $200 in credits. This should be more than enough for the requirements of this class and provides access to more than 30 services at no cost. While these credits cover most needs, you should still budget approximately $50 for additional usage beyond the free services.

## Grading

**NOTE: When assigning final grades, the instructor reserves the right to alter these division points (up or down) based on the overall evaluation of individual or class performance and effort.**

## Term Project

This course has a project that you will work on throughout the term and should comprise of many of the topics and technologies we will cover in class. The Term Project will count for **30%** towards the overall grade.

Team size can be 4-5 students and can be either self-formed or randomly assigned. Each team can either choose their own project or select from the pre-defined project templates. For either option, this will require utilizing multiple AWS technologies using your AWS account. There are wide variety of areas to explore, so teams are encouraged to design a project that is creative, challenging and fun! It is important this can be accomplished within the semester and more importantly, the *effort* needs to reflect the size of the team.

**NOTE: Prior to working on the project, it must first be approved by the instructor.**

Though the term project is a single grade per team, the instructor may make **individual adjustments** to the term project grade in either direction based on the assessment of your contribution to the project through the instructor’s observations and the assessment of your teammates.

For more details on the [term project](/docs/project), see myCourses under **Content > Project > Term Project**. For details on the [grading rubric](/docs/project/grade-rubric) for the term project, see **Content > Project > Term Project Grade Rubric**.

## Activities/Homework

Activities/Homework will account for **25%** of the overall grade. They are intended to provide a valuable opportunity to do hands-on work using the cloud technologies discussed in class. Many of these can be used on the term project, so it is important students are actively engaged on completing the assigned activities.

**Activities** focus on either hands-on exercises or smaller group discussions on a cloud-related topic (e.g. Auto-scaling). These will primarily be done during class with one or more deliverables due by end of or start of the following class.

**Homework** will be assigned, which is an extension of the in-class activities or lectures and further reinforces certain areas that are relevant to getting students up to speed on AWS on some of the technologies required for the term project.

For most Activities/Homework, proof of completion will require a screen shot, which should be uploaded to the specified **Assignments** in myCourses.

**NOTE: For any Activities that are submitted after the due date, students will have up to 2 days from the due date to turn it in but can only earn up to 50% of the late Activity and will not be eligible for any bonus points if offered. Anything past this time will be a graded a 0. No exceptions. Homework assignments will not be eligible for late submissions.**

## Attendance Policy

Students are required to attend and expected to participate in class.

You are permitted one *unexcused absence* (slept in, car won't start, etc.) with no consequences. For additional unexcused absences, you will lose 1% off your final grade.

*Excused absence* will only be granted for very good reasons (job interviews known in advance, documented sickness, family emergencies, and so on). All requests for excused absences are accepted only by email to your instructor before the beginning of class.

**Please do not ask to attend online because you feel unwell or have a conflict.**

Note that for certain team activities that are due by end of class, students may either lose or not get credit if they are not present regardless of whether this is an excused or unexcused absence.

## Using AI

As AI continues to advance, it’s crucial to recognize the benefits it offers while avoiding over-reliance on this technology. For your class projects and assignments, you’re welcome to use generative AI to assist with coding and your term project. We will also explore opportunities to integrate AI into your term project, which will be discussed in more detail during class.
