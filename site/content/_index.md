## Engineering Self-Adaptive Software Systems with Reinforcement Learning

Units: 3 credit-hours

### Instructor

Naveen Sharma (Naveen.Sharma@rit.edu)

### Course Motivation and Description

Modern software systems must be highly configurable, resilient, continuously available, recoverable, and selfoptimizing. One of the most promising approaches to achieving such properties is to equip software systems with self-adaptation and self-managing mechanisms. In brief, self-adaptive systems can adjust their behavior in response to their perception of the environment and the system itself. This course introduces graduate students to key concepts and techniques underlying self-adaptive and autonomic software systems engineering. The course will cover the foundational engineering principles and methodology for achieving self-adaptive systems modeling, machine learning, and feedback control. Students will review/summarize selected seminal research papers on these topics and work on a term-long project.

### Topics

To prepare students for graduate work on models, design techniques and technologies for self-adaptive software systems.

1. Self-adaptive software systems: concepts, overview of techniques, case studies
2. Autonomic Computing: Introduction and concept, MAPE-K model, utility functions, design of autonomic systems
3. Reinforcement Learning: Introduction to machine learning, reinforcement learning concepts for self-adaptation, overview and Markov decision process formulation, stochastic dynamic programming algorithms, function approximations, exploration and exploitation, multi-arm bandits, model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, and software system applications.
4. Introductory Deep Learning, Deep RL
5. Introductory Feedback Control: Introductions, linear systems analysis, PID controller design, and applications in software systems.
6. Research Papers Reading: 6-8 seminal research papers on self-adaptive systems, RL, and control system applications.
7. Term Project: Student-led term project to implement a significant aspect of self-adaptive system

### Expected Work and Grading

There are three expected components in the course. The grades will be determined based on demonstrated work on four components: 

1. 2 Midterm Exams
2. Roughly 8 homework assignments (including a few miniprogramming projects)
3. semester-long class project
4. students are expected to read the assigned paper and present in class.

### Prerequisite

There are no formal prerequisites for the course. The course is intended for graduate students with backgrounds in software development (SWEN-261, SWEN-601, SWEN-610 or equivalent) and basic data analysis. Working knowledge in Python or any other programming language will be expected.
