## Course Description

A system’s software architecture is the first technical artifact that illustrates a proposed solution to a stated problem. For all but the simplest system, the achievement of qualities such as flexibility, modifiability, security, and reliability is critically dependent on the components and interactions defined by the architecture. The course focuses on the definition of architectural structures, the analysis of architectures in terms of trade-offs among conflicting constraints, the documentation of architecture for use over a product’s life cycle, and the role of architecture during coding activities.

**Prerequisites:** SWEN-601, SWEN-610, and SWEN-746 or equivalent.

**Format:** Lecture, 3 credit hours (Fall).

## Textbook

*Software Architecture in Practice* (3rd ed.) by Len Bass, Paul Clements, and Rick Kazman, Addison-Wesley, 2013.

## Course Objectives

* Understand software architecture descriptions and patterns.
* Identify and analyze the architectural structures and patterns of existing systems.
* Design new software systems using appropriate architectural patterns.
* Create documentation that satisfies the needs of clients and developers.
* Perform commonality analysis for software product lines.

## Course Structure

The course includes lectures, projects, quizzes/exams, and activities. Readings will be assigned from the textbook and other materials. There will be periodic quizzes and a mid-term exam, but no final exam.

## Participation and Attendance

Class participation includes active engagement in team projects and classroom learning. Peer evaluations affect individual project grades. One unexcused absence is allowed without penalty; additional absences reduce the final grade by 1% per incident (up to 5% of the participation score).

Excused absences include documented illness, family emergencies, interviews, or school-related activities. Contact the instructor in advance whenever possible.

## Academic Integrity

All students are expected to abide by the RIT Honor Code and Student Academic Integrity Policy. Plagiarism and cheating are violations and will be addressed according to university policy.
