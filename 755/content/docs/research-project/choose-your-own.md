## Final Research Project (“Choose Your Own Adventure” Version)

You and your team will carry out a research project based on software architecture. This allows you more flexibility in exploring the field of software architecture outside of the provided project on architectural failures. However, it involves more efforts in designing a good research project.

Each team will:

* Design a research project related to software architecture and get a project proposal approved prior to starting the project. 
* Conduct research related to software architecture.
* Write a technical report about the research project. 
* Submit a report draft mid-way through the project.
* Create a 10-12 minute presentation on their case and present this to the class. 
* Provide a 5-minute Q&A session after their presentation.

## Project Proposal Criteria

The project proposal needs to be approved prior to beginning the project.

* Please fill out the “final project proposal” and submit this to the instructor by the required due date. 
* If this is not submitted on time, you may not proceed to do a “choose your own adventure” project, and must do the “architectural failure case study” project instead.

## Technical Report Criteria

The final technical report shall contain certain elements and criteria as outlined below.

* Introduction and motivation for the project. 
    * 3 research questions (RQs) that are being evaluated.
* Background:
    * Overview of the project to help the audience understand the study. It is recommended to include relevant architectural views (diagrams) describing the type of architecture being studied. 
* Overview of the methodology used to conduct the study. 
    * What did you do? 
    * How did you do it? 
* Discussion of research results, including examples.
    * This is where the RQs are answered. *Important: there needs to be results or evidence to support these.* 
* Discussion of future works.
    * What is still to learn? 
* Conclusion section. 
* Supplementary documents containing any artifacts created during the project and/or additional data required to understand the results. 
* Citations and references. 
* Length: 5-8 pages (including figures/tables, but excluding references)
* IEEE conference template (Word or LaTeX): https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
    * Tip: For Word, you may collaborate using Google Docs, and for LaTeX, you may use Overleaf to collaborate with your team.

## Presentation Criteria

* Slides:
    * Any number needed to meet your presentation timing goal. 
    * If outside sources are being used, they should be referenced (either in the slide the source is used or at the end). 
* 10-12 minute presentation:
    * Should contain: introductions, background, methodology, results, conclusion.
    * Each teammate should present part of the presentation. 
* 5 minute panel-style Q&A:
    * Each teammate answers at least one question.
    * Your classmates are encouraged to ask questions.

## Peer-eval check-in

This will be completed in two phases:

### Phase 1

To be completed mid-way through your project. It will consist of a written peer-evaluation for each of your teammates. Each teammate will receive their feedback so that they can improve. Each individual’s evaluations will be grouped and names will be removed.

### Phase 2

To be completed at the end of the project. It will consist of final peer evaluations in the form of a questionnaire and will be a part of each individual’s final project grade.
