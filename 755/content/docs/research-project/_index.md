## Final Research Project

You and your team will search the media and other online resources to find an example of a major software failure that occurred due to risks in software architecture, missing architecturally significant requirements, implementing architecture incorrectly, technical debt, and/or similar issues.

Each team will:

* Conduct a case study on the system and its failure.
* Write a technical report about the case study. 
* Submit a report draft mid-way through the project.
* Create a 10-12 minute presentation on their case and present this to the class. 
* Provide a 5-minute Q&A session after their presentation.

## Technical Report Criteria

The final technical report shall contain certain elements and criteria as outlined below.

* Introduction and motivation for the case study. 
* Background:
    * Overview of the system. It is recommended to include architectural views (diagrams) describing the type of architecture the system has. 
    * Overview of the failure. What happened? How did it happen?
* Overview of the methodology used to conduct the study. 
    * What did you do? 
    * How did you do it? 
* Discussion of research results, including examples.
    * Why did the architectural failure happen? 
    * Why is the failure architectural?
    * What should have been done differently? *Important: there needs to be some evidence or reasoning behind why you believe that this would have prevented (or mitigated) the failure. This may be in the form of a prototype program, a detailed literature review, or an implementation of another research method.*
* Discussion of future works.
    * What is still to learn? 
* Conclusion section. 
* Supplementary documents containing any artifacts created during the project and/or additional data required to understand the results. 
* Citations and references. 
* Length: 5-8 pages (including figures/tables, but excluding references)
* IEEE conference template (Word or LaTeX): https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
    * Tip: For Word, you may collaborate using Google Docs, and for LaTeX, you may use Overleaf to collaborate with your team.

## Presentation Criteria

* Slides:
    * Any number needed to meet your presentation timing goal. 
    * If outside sources are being used, they should be referenced (either in the slide the source is used or at the end). 
* 10-12 minute presentation:
    * Should contain: introductions, background, methodology, results, conclusion.
    * Each teammate should present part of the presentation. 
* 5 minute panel-style Q&A:
    * Each teammate answers at least one question.
    * Your classmates are encouraged to ask questions.

## Peer-eval check-in

This will be completed in two phases:

### Phase 1

To be completed mid-way through your project. It will consist of a written peer-evaluation for each of your teammates. Each teammate will receive their feedback so that they can improve. Each individual’s evaluations will be grouped and names will be removed.

### Phase 2

To be completed at the end of the project. It will consist of final peer evaluations in the form of a questionnaire and will be a part of each individual’s final project grade.
