## Course Description:

This is a programming based course to enhance individual, technical engineering knowledge and skills as preparation for masters level graduate work. Students will be introduced to programming language syntax, object oriented concepts, data structures and foundational algorithms. An emphasis will be placed on obtaining practical programming skills, through regular programming assignments and practicum.

## Course Topics:

The course will encompass a variety of concepts and topics, among them are the following:

* Statements, Expressions, Standard Input/Output
* Variables, Types, Functions, Parameters, Arguments
* Arrays, Boolean Expressions, Conditionals, Iteration
* Classes, Objects
* Inheritance, Interfaces, Abstraction
* Recursion
* Searching, Sorting, Complexity
* Abstract Data Types, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hashtables, Graphs
* Exceptions, File Input & Output
* Threads & Concurrency
* Networking

## Course Objectives:

This course provides an accelerated overview of the design and implementation of data structures and algorithms, in order to establish a common baseline of programming ability for graduate students in the Software Engineering and Data Science programs, who come from diverse backgrounds. This course replaces and builds upon the introductory undergraduate computer science sequence. By the end of this course, students should have practical programming skills and knowledge of common data structures and algorithms.

Learning outcomes include:

* The student will have practical experience with fundamental computer algorithms and data structures.
* The student will learn object oriented programming and basic OO design.
* The student will gain experience with modern programming tools such as integrated development environments, command line tools, text editors, and compilers.
* The student will understand how to analyze and determine the computational complexity of algorithms.

## Method of Instruction:

This course will combine frequent active learning problems into the lecture period. Each lecture will begin with a short (~5 minute) quiz regarding the previous lecture's material. IN a typical week, the student will be responsible for two small homework assignments and two quizzes. Student progress will be assessed with three practica (coding exams).

## Textbook(s):

Students will receive all of the material that they need during the class in the form of lecture handouts and supplemental materials as needed. A textbook is not required.

Recommended:

* "Effective Java, 3rd Edition", Joshua Bloch - This text is geared towards programmers that are already familiar with the Java language and want to learn how to maximize the efficient use of the language.

## Attendance Policy:

Attending class is expected. Quizzes will be given at the start of each lecture, and students will be expected to complete any in-class activities (e.g. small coding problems provided as a handout). Students that miss class without good reason will not be given an opportunity to make up missed work.

## Academic Honesty

[RIT's Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d080) defines the basic forms of academic dishonesty (cheating, duplicate submission, and plagiarism) and explains the official RIT policy regarding academic dishonesty.

Apart from the coding activities during lecture, all work in this course is individual. All other quizzes, in-class activities, assignments, and practica are expected to be the result of individual effort, not teamwork or collaboration. Students are permitted to discuss class activities and assignments with other students provided that it is not at a level of detail that results in more than one student writing identical solutions. In other words, high level discussion of topics, approaches, or algorithms with other students are acceptable, but low level implementation details (such as line-by-line descriptions of a solution) are prohibited.

Submitting work that was authored all-or-in-part by another individual is considered a violation of academic honesty. Conversely, providing all-or-part of a solution to another student is also a violation of academic honesty. There are many other forms of cheating including using internet cheat sites to find solutions to course assignments or practica, sharing practica with students in other (or future) sections of the course, and many more. There is not sufficient space here to list every possible behavior or action that constitutes cheating. Any action that undermines the academic integrity of the course, the students, or the university may constitute a violation of the policy. If a student is suspected of cheating, the instructor shall notify the students involved and conduct an investigation in accordance with RIT's Academic Integrity Policy.

If the investigation conducted by the instructor determines that the student violated RIT's Academic Integrity Policy, the minimum penalty is a 0 for the assignment on which the student cheated. Multiple and/or egregious violations will result in a failing grade in the course and a note in the student's permanent record. Subsequent offenses (e.g. in later courses) will be treated as additional instances of academic honesty and may result in a failing grade in the course (even for a single offense) or expulsion from the program or university.

## Use of GPT/ AI

Again, all work is required to be your original creation. In situations where use of online resources is prohibited, this includes prohibition of GPT/ AI. In situations where it is not prohibited (unless otherwise stated), you may use online search for reference, but the output you create must be your own. This includes situations where you may use GPT or other AI tools for searching and/ or reference, with the following provisos:

If you use GPT (ChatGPT or other, similar tools) you must also do the following:

1. Submit your prompts for GPT (as a separate file) as part of your work
2. Provide a confirming statement that GPT was used as reference only, and your work is original.

If ANY of your work is found to be copied (from online sources OR ChatGPT/ AI), you would be subject to serious penalties which could be one or more of the following:

* Zero on the assignment
* Zero on a full project
* “F” on the course
* Reported as plagiarism to the University and subsequent disciplinary action at the Institution level

In short - just don't do it. It's not worth the consequences to cheat (and it's not ethical)!

## Grading Breakdown:

A final course grade is a combination of your grades on quizzes, homework assignments, practica, and a cumulative final exam.
