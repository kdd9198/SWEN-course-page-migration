## Syllabus – Data-Driven Software Engineering & Modeling

## Course Description

This course treats **software engineering as a data problem**. Students learn to model software structure and processes and to mine the rich data emitted by modern development platforms (Git, CI/CD, issue trackers, telemetry). Using statistical and machine-learning techniques—including large language models (LLMs)—they will predict quality, detect anomalies, and generate useful artefacts (tests, documentation, UML). Emphasis is placed on reproducible empirical methods, explainable models, and responsible AI use.

## Course Objectives

* Collect & curate large-scale software-engineering datasets from public or private repositories.
* Construct formal and data-driven models (e.g., UML, call graphs, embeddings) to represent software systems and developer activity.
* Engineer features & train predictive models that estimate defects, risk, or developer behaviour, and interpret these models with explainable-AI techniques.
* Apply LLMs responsibly to generate, transform, and validate software artefacts while recognising limitations, bias, and hallucination.
* Design, execute, and report rigorous empirical studies of software-engineering questions, addressing threats to validity and ensuring reproducibility.
* Communicate insights visually and verbally, crafting dashboards or reports that aid technical decision-making.

## Grading Scale

Assignment weights are detailed on the course web site. Final letter grades follow the departmental ± scale:

## Academic Integrity & Plagiarism

All work you submit must be your own or properly credited. Do not post solutions or project code in any public forum (e.g., public GitHub). Sharing or copying code, datasets, or analyses without explicit permission violates RIT’s Academic Integrity Policy and will result in disciplinary action.

## Generative-AI / LLM Usage Policy

We encourage exploration of tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Claude, provided you are fully transparent:

* **Disclosure** – Any deliverable that incorporates LLM-generated text, code, diagrams, prompts, or analyses must include a brief “LLM Usage” appendix that lists the tool(s) used, key prompts/instructions given, and which portions of the work were AI-generated or AI-assisted.
* **Verification** – You are responsible for verifying correctness, originality, and freedom from license conflicts or sensitive-data leaks.
* **Original Contribution** – Submissions must demonstrate your own understanding and effort; indiscriminate copy-paste is plagiarism.
* **Prohibited Uses** – Using an LLM to circumvent individual-work requirements or to fabricate data/experiments is academic misconduct.

Failure to follow these guidelines will be treated as an integrity violation.
