Your branch name should be `client2-dev`. When you have merged, the tag should be `client2`.

Now you have seen what it looks like to have a tiny bit of dynamic functionality on a webpage, let’s start thinking bigger. Modern websites that have a lot of client-side functionality use component-based frameworks. We’ll be using [React.js](https://react.dev/), which is one of the most popular ones out there today.

Our goal with this iteration is to achieve **feature parity**, perhaps with some improvements along the way. Your app will hopefully look and act nearly exactly as before, but will be easier to build upon for future features.
