Everyone must do this part, even if you think you are familiar with React.js.

1. Do our [React Setup instructions](/docs/project/client-project/react-setup). Be sure to review the walkthrough explanation of all the files.
2. Review the resources available to you at [Getting Started with React](https://react.dev/). We have found these resources to be very well-written and helpful.
3. They have a [Tic Tac Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) that shows everything together. Please do this tutorial, as it will prepare you for your assignment.

Commit your tutorial code to your repository, to the branch `client2-dev` into a separate folder.

* i.e. create a sub-folder in your repo called ‘react-guide’, and place your files for the tutorial you used in there.
