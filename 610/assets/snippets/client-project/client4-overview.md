In this assignment, you will retain **functional parity** with client-3, but move all your persitent data from the client side to the DB server. You will again be using PostgreSQL and Flask based RESTful APIs as your mechanism for accessing the DB.
Your branch name should be `client4-dev`. When you have merged, the tag should be `client4`.

Be sure to update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to update the `PROJECT_NAME4` variable
