## DB0: Setup

DB0 is the same for everyone, regardless of project.

For setting up in the lab or on your own machine, follow our [DB Project Setup Instructions](/docs/project/db-project).

### Grading DB0

* 10pts. All steps implemented
* 10pts. CI fully passes

{{% hint warning %}}

Grading notes:

* Make sure you tagged the commit as `db0` so we can find it easily.
* We grade GitLab only, unless an instructor or TA has given explicit written instructions that you can bypass the CI (which is rare)
