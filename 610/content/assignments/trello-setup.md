If given the green light, coordinate in your team's Slack workspace to determine who will do this.

* **Create a Trello *WORKSPACE* (not a board) for your project using the same naming convention used to setup your team's Slack workspace.**
    * Use the team name `tttt-SWEN-610-ss-a-name` where:
        * `tttt` is the academic term, e.g. 2225
        * `ss` is your section number, e.g. 05
        * `a is the letter for your team assigned by your instructor, e.g. a, b, c, d, e
        * `name` is a name the team creates for itself
* Invite the members of your term project team to this Trello workspace.
* Invite the **instructor (and course assistant, if any)** to this Trello workspace and make sure to give them `Admin` role under the Members section.
* Your instructor will copy the project's Trello starter board to your team. **You do not need to create a Trello board.**
