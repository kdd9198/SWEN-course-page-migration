## Design Documentation Exercise

### Introduction

This team exercise has you starting to create your design documentation.

### Step 1: Edit your design document

1. A Design Document Template has been provided in your github repository in the top level `/docs` directory.
2. The `Designdoc.md` template file is in markdown format. Check the Resources page for [tools to edit markdown files](/docs/resources#markdown-formatting).
3. Add the following information in your design document:
    * Complete the **Team Information** section.
    * Write an **Executive Summary** for the project.
    * Insert your domain model and write the high-level overview of the domain for the application.
    * Remove the comments from all sections where you have filled in information.

    Note: You must have the actual image files physically in your repository `/docs` directory. When the PDF generator runs, it will most likely not have the necessary permissions to access a remote resource holding an image file. This is also a good practice because it will allow you to track revisions of your documentation including which images were placed in revisions of the document.

4. Add and commit this to your repository with an appropriate comment.
5. Merge this update into your `master` branch and push to the remote.

### Step 2: Create a PDF of your design document

A PDF (Portable Document Format) is a professional looking document which includes page numbers and figure captions. There are a few options avialable to create PDF from markdown files:

#### VSCode Extension

* The VSCode extension [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) converts markdown files to pdf, html, png or jpeg files.
* After installing the extension, open your `DesignDoc.md` and right-click in the file area and choose *Markdown PDF: (Export pdf)*.
* The `DesignDoc.pdf` will be created in the `/docs` directory
* You can preview the rendered markdown version directly in VSCode.

#### Pandoc and MiKTex

* You can use the [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) tool combination to create a PDF from your markdown design document. These tools are installed on the SE lab machines. There are Mac and Windows versions that you can download to your own machine.
* There is a maven execution id that you can run to generate the PDF file with pandoc. From the `/docs` directory, use the maven command: `mvn exec:exec@docs`. The PDF file will be in `DesignDoc.pdf` file.

Notes

* For anybody trying to run the `mvn exec:exec@docs` and receiving errors on a mac, this may be caused by a missing dependency called `pdflatex`. It can be fixed by installing `mactex` via homebrew as described here: https://superuser.com/questions/1038612/where-do-i-get-the-pdflatex-program-for-mac
* If you want to generate the PDF outside of maven, use the command: `pandoc DesignDoc.md -o DesignDoc.pdf`

By the time specified on the schedule for your section, put *only* the generated `DesignDoc.pdf` file in the *Design documentation - team* in the MyCourses Assignments *Team Exercises* area.
