## Trello Initiation

### Exercises

#### What you have to do by the due date

By the date indicated on your class schedule do the following as a team:

* Create a new Trello board for your team and add the initial User Stories listed below as cards in your Sprint Backlog list. You will begin handling these for Sprint 1.
* Post any requirements questions to the Slack or Discord channel for your team.
* Clean these user stories up, put them into the format prescribed in our Defining Project Requirements lecture. The final result should be a *prioritized* list of User Stories and Epic cards. Provide a short title for each card, and the story text written in the standard format. At this point, you do not have to define Story Points, Acceptance Criteria, or Solution Tasks for User Stories that will be implemented in later sprints (*although beginning to think/talk about them will give your team a huge advantage). Epic cards should have all of the associated User Story cards linked to the **Stories** list by copying the URL for each constituent User Story and pasting it as a checklist item in the **Stories** list. See the [Defining Project Requirements lecture](/slides/defining-project-requirements.pptx) for details.
* Click [here](/documents/product-backlog-example.docx) for a sample of a good Epic/Story hierarchy and a few good Stories to demonstrate the level of detail expected.

Initial User Stories for Sprint 0

1. **User Registration:** As a User, I want to create an account so that I can access the Task Manager.
2. **User Login:** As a User, I want to log in so that I can securely access my personal tasks.
3. **Task Creation:** As a User, I want to add a new task with a title, description, and due date so that I can keep track of my responsibilities.
4. **Task Viewing:** As a User, I want to view a list of my tasks so that I can see all my pending work in one place.
5. **Task Updating:** As a User, I want to update a task's details (title, description, due date) so that I can correct or refine the information.
6. **Task Completion:** As a User, I want to mark a task as completed so that I can track my progress.
7. **Task Deletion:** As a User, I want to delete a task so that I can remove items that are no longer relevant.
8. **Completed Task Viewing:** As a User, I want to view only my completed tasks so that I can review what I've accomplished.
9. **Task Categorization:** As a User, I want to create categories and assign tasks to a category so that I can organize related tasks together.

Suggested Trello Board Structure

* **Product Backlog** - holds all stories and epics not yet scheduled for a sprint.
* **Sprint Backlog** - stories selected for the current sprint.
* **In Progress** - stories that are currently being worked on.
* **Done** - stories that have been fully implemented and meet acceptance criteria.

You may add more lists (e.g., "Testing" or "Review") as your team develops its workflow, but you must include at least these four columns.
