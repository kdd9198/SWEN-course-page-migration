## Git Resources

The [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a fantastic resource for explaining the concepts and workflows of Git. All of it is great. Of particular use to SWEN 610 students would be:

* 1.3 Getting Started - What is Git?
* 2.1 Git Basics - Getting a Repository
* 2.4 Git Basics - Undoing Things
* 2.6 Git Basics - Tagging
* 3.1 Git Branching - Branches in a Nutshell
* 3.4 Git Branching - Branching Workflows (specifically topic branches)
* 7.7 Git Tools - Reset Demystified

The [Git reference pages](https://git-scm.com/docs) are also quite good… if you know what command you’re supposed to be using. Looking at examples first helps immensely. Specifically, these pages are invaluable:

* [git add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add)
* [git commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)
* [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push)
* [git checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)
* [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)
* [git branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)

These pages are also useful:

* [git tag](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag)
* [git pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull)
* [git show](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-show)
* [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

For clients, we recommend using the command line because that’s how Git is originally intended to be used. However, having a graphical view of the project can also be helpful. We recommend tools like [Git Extensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/) that show the tree. We recommend you avoid tools like GitHub Desktop as they hide too many details from you.
