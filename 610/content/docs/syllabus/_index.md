## Course Description

This course is an introduction to Software Engineering. This course is meant to introduce students to general topics in software engineering, and have students practice that knowledge by working on a term-long team-based project.

## Course Topics

The course will discuss software engineering in four broad areas of a software engineer's daily practice:

* Software design
* Software process
* Teamwork
* Communication

## Course Objectives

This course aims for you to learn both individual and team-based software engineering skills. Software design skills include basic object-oriented design skills and design principles relevant across classes and application subsystems. Software development teams need to appreciate the benefits derived from following a disciplined process and the practices that lead to high product quality. Teamwork is a critical skill that students will develop primarily through their project activities. These team skills will include running effective team meetings, assigning tasks, coordinating activities, and handling issues within the team. Finally, you will learn communication skills from code and design documentation to oral presentations about your completed project work. Project teams will use up-to-date development techniques and tools when performing their project work.

## Method of Instruction

This course will combine lecture and in-class activities along with a term-long software development project. In addition, students will collaborate inside and outside of class in support of project activities and deliverables. There are several phased project deliverables highlighted on the course schedule and in the project information.

See the [expectations]({{< ref "/docs/syllabus/expectations.md" >}}) page for a description of how the course instruction will work.

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course. Each course topic will list the resources that students will use for their study. These resources will include: lectures, class exercises, project work, public resources on the web, and e-learning resources available through the RIT library, such as material on [LinkedIn](https://infoguides.rit.edu/linkedinlearning) and [O'Reilly for Higher Education](https://infoguides.rit.edu/ohe) resources

## Attendance Policy

No other way to say it: **Come to class, your and (indirectly) your teammates' grade depend on it!** Many class sessions will have class exercises and activities with submitted work that contributes to the Class Exercises portion of your grade. If you miss class, you cannot get credit for the exercises. There will also be class time set aside for term project work. All team members not being present to participate in these team activities will be a detriment to the effectiveness of your project team. That said, you have one late arrival and one unexcused absence (slept in, car won't start, etc.) with no additional deduction.

{{% hint warning %}}
It is your responsibility to notify the instructor **at the end of class the day** you arrived late to avoid it being counted as absence. Attempts to correct this at later dates will not be granted. If you have to be absent due to health concerns be sure to reach out **as soon as you are aware** and in advance of the class session. (e.g. you have failed dailyhealth and are being asked to quarantine).

**Be professional.** Practice common courtesy when your instructor or your fellow colleagues are speaking. Refrain from game play, social media or any other unprofessional use of devices while in class.

**Be compliant and safe for ALL of us.** Current RIT policy requires all of us to comply with NY State-wide mandates given the pandemic as well as reasonable norms of conduct for all Staff, Faculty and Students. If you have not yet done so it is important that you familiarize with the expectations of conduct as well as the resources available to support you and the RIT community.

## Term Project

### Overview

The focal point of the course is a term long project executed by a team of 4-5 students. The goal of the project is to introduce and practice the fundamental team-based software development skills that lead to delivery of a quality software product. Teams will be formed during Week 1 and will remain together throughout the term. Your instructor will explain the process for forming teams during the first class session. Simulating a real world project development environment is challenging due to the short amount of time teams are able to meet in person. Time will be allocated during some class sessions for project teams to meet and work. It is critical that you are present for these sessions, as your absence from class adversely affects your team's ability to make progress. It is also equally important for the team to take advantage of this time to interact with their instructor who will be available to offer guidance and provide clarification on product requirements. Significant time will also be required outside of the classroom to meet and work as a team.

### Project Artifacts

There are several deliveries of project artifacts through the term. Artifacts in a delivery may include product code, documentation, test results, information about team activity, and a team reflection on the work accomplished. There are also multiple team exercises that get submitted through the term and contribute to a portion of the team grade. Through the term, there will also be several in-class team presentations and product demonstrations. Exactly which artifacts are contained in each delivery is described on webpages linked on the course schedule page. Your instructor will grade the artifacts in each delivery and provide feedback to the team.

### Expectations

Participating in the term project is perhaps the most valuable experience you will take from this course. Far more projects fail as a result of poor collaboration and communication within project teams than they do for any technical short-comings. Becoming an effective team member is a critical career skill and the goal of this project is to gain some experience with effective (and non-effective) teaming practices. The expectation is that each team member will make an honest effort in participating in team activities to the best of his or her ability. Should non-constructive conflict arise, your instructor will expect the team to first make an effort to resolve issues internally. Beyond that your instructor will intercede as needed to help in resolving team issues.

## Individual Exercises

A number of exercises will be conducted throughout the term to reinforce course topics and activities the teams are performing on their projects. Other exercises will also be run to support the introduction of tools and techniques used in the team's product development. Most class exercises will have a submission which depending on the activity are done individually, by project team, or by a group setup for the specific activity. These exercises will be scheduled to be done both in-class and outside of class. There will be no acceptance of class exercise submissions after its due date. You can easily gain those points back in the ways just described.

## Grading of Individual Exercises and possible Take-home(s)

Your Individual Exercises are evaluated based on whether you were engaged with the activity more than detailed grading of each element of the activity. In most cases, for each activity you will be given 0 (no submission or very poor work) or 1 (expected level of engagement) point. Occasionally, a student will make an exceptional contribution in a class exercise, and the instructor may award a bonus point, i.e. 2 points for the activity. For some class exercises that have multiple parts, the exercise may have a value of 1 point for each part. Each individual part is graded on the 0, 1, or 2 scale. Note: activities that use a myCourses quiz, have fractional grading based on the number of questions answered correctly. The total for most quizzes is 1 point, though some with more detailed questions are worth more than one point. Your instructor may add bonus points for exceptional answers to individual quiz questions. At the discretion of your instructor, other take-home assignments may be given to confirm your grasp of the material and to prepare you for formal exams.

All of your Individual Exercise and take-home contribution points are summed together to compute the Individual Exercises portion of your final grade. The grading is based on the percentage of contributions you made against the expected number of contributions. You are expected to submit every class exercise. A the discretion of your instructor, if you miss submitting a class exercise, you may be able to make up those points at a later date through a take-home. You can also make up the points by obtaining bonus points in one or more of your class exercise submissions.

## Deliverables

The due date and time for deliverables are noted on the course schedule. Deliveries are done through myCourses dropbox, or the online development tools that the project team is using, i.e. GitHub, Trello, and Slack.
