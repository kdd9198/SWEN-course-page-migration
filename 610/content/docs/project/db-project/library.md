## DB Project - Library System

You are a tech company that provides an application for managing a library system. The application has the basic concepts of users, items in the library (books mainly) and checking out any of the items to borrow for a period of time. The app also has a system where you can track late fees (for those inconsiderate people who are late returning things!).
