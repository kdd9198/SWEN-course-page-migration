## Creating Github Releases

To release your code at the end of a sprint, you will use GitHub's release mechanism naming your releases `vS.n` where `S` is the sprint number, `n` is a minor release number starting at 0. There is nothing you need to do in MyCourses. Your instructor will simply pull down your release tag and review the code directly; no messy ZIP files.

Use the instructions below to create your code release for sprints 1 through 4. You must do this before the submission deadline.

***NOTE:*** once created a release tag cannot be altered; meaning you cannot change which commit point the release points to; it's frozen. Make sure that the code is in the shape that you want before you create a release. It is OK if you create early releases as a safety measure, and then make subsequent releases. You will be graded on the latest version of the `vX` release that was created before the due date. For each subsequent release, increment the minor release number, i.e the `.n` part of the release tag. Use the same release title, and indicate why a new release was created along with the standard information your instructor should know about the release, such as features that are missing or are buggy.

1. Navigate to your project's GitHub home page. The top of the page, will look something like the following screenshot.<br><br>![GitHub project home](/images/github-project-home.png)

2. Click on the `releases` link in the row: `commits | branches | releases | contributors`. This will take you to a releases page similar to the screenshot below.<br><br>![GitHub releases page](/images/github-releases-page.png)

3. Click on the *Create a new release* button. Fill-in the release form similar to the screenshot below. Use an initial release tag of `vX.0.` where `X` is the sprint number. Start with a `.0` version. Make sure that the title is clearly marked as the *Sprint X submission*, and provide an accurate description of the release including anything that your instructor should know about the release, such as features that are missing or are buggy. After the form is filled out click the *Publish* release button.<br><br>![GitHub release tagging](/images/github-release-tagging.png)
