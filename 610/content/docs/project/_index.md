## Term Project

This course has a project that you will work on through the term. You will choose 1 team mate. Teams will only be adjusted if need-be (as determined by the instructor). Refer to the Vision Document for more information.

### Individual Team Member Evaluation

Everyone on your team will receive a team grade based on the overall performance of the team. Individual adjustments to the team grade will be made based on the level of participation of each team member. Your instructor will assess individual team member participation using the following evidence:

* Trello sprint planning board logs
* Team Discord presence with meaningful contributions
* GitHub contributions
    * Commits performed
    * Issues opened/closed
    * Pull requests issued/reviewed

## Inception Phase / Sprint 0

{{% hint %}}

"As the first of the four phases in the project lifecycle, Inception is about understanding the project scope and objectives and getting enough information to confirm that the project should proceed - or to convince you that it should not."

All of the information you need about the project for Sprint 0 is in the [Vision document.]({{< ref "/docs/project/vision.md" >}})

### Project Activities

* Project submissions
    * [Domain model]({{< ref "/topics/domain-analysis.md" >}})
    * [Product backlog]({{< ref "/assignments/trello-initiation.md" >}})
* Other grading dimensions
    * Individual team member visibility in Discord workspace
    * Team activity on Gitlab and Trello
    * Each team member has completed DB1 and DB2

### Submission Instructions

* Create a consolidated [Domain model]({{< ref "/topics/domain-analysis.md" >}}) that incorporates the best elements from each student's domain model. Submit your team's domain model as a PDF file in a directory called 'domain model' at the root of your repo.
* Create your Product Backlog by populating your Trello planning board with a consolidated set of User and Spike Stories, and Epics following the instructions here. Your instructor will look at your planning activity directly in your Trello board.
* Your instructor will look at your team communications participation directly in your Discord workspace channels.
