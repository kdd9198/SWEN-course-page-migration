## Acceptance Test Plan

Your team will keep an up-to-date Acceptance Test Plan through the Construction phases of the project. This test plan is the set of all the user stories in the Product Backlog with their Acceptance Criteria and any specific test cases that you define. Since Product acceptance is from the perspective of the end-user, only add User Stories that pertain to end-user roles (e.g. "AS an owner...", "AS a player...", etc) and do not include User Stories specifically for the REST API service (e.g. AS a developer...). This test plan will be part of your Sprint 2 and 3 submissions.

### Sprint 2

You'll need to create acceptance tests based on the acceptance criteria you have defined by now. Create a spreadsheet file called "acceptance_test" in excel or google sheets. Fill it with your acceptance tests.

When you execute the acceptance tests on the Sprint 2 user stories indicate the Pass/Fail result and any comments for the test. For all tests, the tester should place their initials and the date the test was executed in the comments cell. The tester can optionally include additional comments, but if the acceptance test fails, the tester is **required** to provide additional comments describing the failure.

You will submit the Acceptance Test Plan through your Sprint 2 release in your project repository.

### Sprint 3

You will keep your Acceptance Test Plan up-to-date through Sprint 3. This on-going task will include:

Acceptance criteria for all user stories that have been refined to that point
Edits to make the test plan consistent with any changes that may have been made to user stories in your Product and Sprint Backlogs
Test results and tester comments for stories completed during the latest sprint and regression testing of all stories completed in previous sprints.
You will submit the Acceptance Test Plan through each sprint release in your project repository.

During Sprint 3, you will also distribute your up-to-date Acceptance Test Plan to your testers during the in-class Cross-team acceptance testing activity. Those testers will run the acceptance tests on your product and provide their results to you in your test plan spreadsheet.
