## CI/CD Basics & Code Coverage

### Introduction

When do you know that you have sufficient unit tests? Have you covered all of the paths through the code? *Code coverage tools* permit you to inspect just how many lines of code are being covered by the unit tests. This is usually done by measuring the percentage of code covered in a given method, class or whole packages. Knowing these metrics can help a team establish a measurable level of unit testing for each story.

### Learning Outcomes

* Use a *code coverage* tool to analyze the completeness of the unit test suite.
* Establish a team's User Story coverage goal.
