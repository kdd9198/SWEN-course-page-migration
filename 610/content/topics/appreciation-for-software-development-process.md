## Appreciation for Software Development Process

### Introduction

This lesson teaches the benefits of adopting a formal software development process. Specifically, the course adopts OpenUP for strategic process (phases) and Scrum for tactical team operations (sprints, meetings, activities and artifacts).

Because this lesson falls on the first day of class you will not be expected to prepare. All of the content you need will be presented in class.

### Learning Outcomes

* Identify the benefits of a formal software development process.
* Describe the goal for each OpenUP phase.
