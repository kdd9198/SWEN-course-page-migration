## Acceptance Testing

### Introduction

Acceptance testing ensures that the developed software product will meet the business needs of the Product Owner/customer. These business needs are captured by the user stories in the Product Backlog that the Product Owner helped to create and prioritize. Each user story needs to be refined with more details. This is done with the creation of the Acceptance Criteria for user stories during Backlog Refinement in preparation for the next Sprint Planning session.

### Learning Outcomes

* Describe the purpose of acceptance criteria and acceptance testing.
* Identify who is responsible for creating acceptance criteria and when it is done.
