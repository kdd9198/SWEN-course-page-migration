## Design Documentation

### Introduction

{{% hint %}}

"A design document is a way for you to communicate to others what your design decisions are and why your decisions are good decisions."

From [How to Write an Effective Design Document](https://writebtl.wordpress.com/2011/06/) by Scott Hackett

Many software projects span many years and it is natural for team members to leave and others arrive. Design documentation is a useful tool for bringing new members up-to-speed quickly. A good design doc provides a high-level perspective of the requirements, domain and architecture. And as appropriate selected sub-systems are described in detail.

### Learning Outcomes

* Create a document that provides a high-level view of a system's architecture and design.
* Create simple and effective system and subsystem models.

### Study Resources

For your study of this topic, use some of these resources.

#### *Web Articles and Blogs*

There are many software architectures; some are more complex than others. Similarly there are many forms of software design documentation; some are much more complex than others. We encourage light-weight documentation that favors quality over quantity. Excerpts of Scott Hackett provides a simple description of design documentation and Martin Fowler provides a humorous encounter with a team's *impressive* documentation.

The Agile Modeling website is full of good content for modeling in an agile environment. This webpage on best practices is a good read.

* [Best Practices for Agile/Lean Documentation](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDocumentationBestPractices.htm)

Many in Agile circles say that *code should be the design documentation* and it is certainly true that good design and clear code communication can enhance a developer's understanding of the system. Here's what Martin Fowler has to say about that:

Finally, software maven Joel Spolsky provides his own take on design document (what he calls "Functional Spec"):

### Class Lecture

* [Design Documentation](/slides/design-documentation.pdf)

### Exercises

#### *After Class Exercises*

* *Design documentation - team* (2 exercise points)
    * As a team, perform the [design documentation exercise](/assignments/design-documentation-exercise) to start the documentation area in your repository. Submit the PDF file of the initial design document before the time indicated on the schedule for your section.
    * Check the Resources page for [tools to edit markdown files](/docs/resources#markdown-formatting).
    * Split up the work for writing the design documentation due in your Sprint 2 submission.

#### *Project Activities*

* The Definition of Done checklist in the STORY template card in your Trello planning board includes a checklist item for "design documentation updated". From this point, when you implement a story you will include updating the design documenation as part of your sprint process.
