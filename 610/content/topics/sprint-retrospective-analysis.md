## Sprint Retrospective Analysis

### Introduction

{{% hint %}}

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

From [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

*Team retrospectives* have a very long history in software engineering. Before agile development processes, these meetings usually happened at the end of a project. Agile practice puts this meeting as an essential element of each Sprint (aka iteration). Doing so helps the team improve its own process and facilitates self-organization.

### Learning Outcomes

* Describe the purpose of a retrospective.
* Conduct a team retrospective.
* List issues that could have a negative impact on a team's effectiveness.
* Identify strategies for overcoming issues that negatively impact a team and for resolving conflicts that might arise within a team.
