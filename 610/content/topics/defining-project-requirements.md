## Defining Project Requirements

### Introduction

This lesson teaches how to define the project requirements by identifying application features and writing user stories that capture specific aspects of each feature.

### Learning Outcomes

* Distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements.
* Write a user story from a product or feature description.
* Identify and correct poorly written user stories.
* Write acceptance criteria for a user story.
* Identify and decompose story epics.
* Identify the need for a Spike story.
* Identify the Minimum Viable Product.

### Study Resources

For your study of this topic, use these resources. All three videos are assigned as a pre-class activity; start there. The articles and blogs provide additional context and examples; focus on the articles on spikes and [MVP](## "Minimum Viable Product). Use the Wikipedia articles as references for deeper exploration.

    **NOTE:** In one place, the *Creating user stories* video makes an equivalence between the *Definition of Done* list and the *Acceptance Criteria* making it sound like these are the same thing. This is not the most common interpretation which is that these are two distinct lists each serving a different purpose. The *Definition of Done* is the same in most user stories and is a list of all the process steps that must be completed to finish development of the user story. The *Acceptance Criteria* are specific to each user story. The criteria are written in a specific format, and each one provides a description of one aspect of the required user story funtionality. Together, all the acceptance criteria should fully define the user story requirements.
